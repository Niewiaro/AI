There’s a buyer for the car.

I don’t know if I’ll make it in time.

Alright.

Cool.

Good luck.

And then I’m heading straight to Sara’s.

F**k, xD. I park, there’s a great spot, and I see a guy who’s probably leaving because the lights are on. I’m standing there for 20 seconds, waiting, flashing my high beams so he knows.  
*Micha³:*  
Another 20 seconds go by, and I realize something’s wrong because there’s no smoke coming from the back.  
*Micha³:*  
Turns out the guy just left the lights on, xD.  
*Micha³:*  
And there’s nobody inside, .

I’m listening 24/7 "Mateusz, flip the switch" so Spotify counts this as my most-played song in 2024.  
*Micha³:*  
The worst part is that I’m starting to like it more and more.  
*Micha³:*  
And the worst part is that I just realized Spotify counts it only until the end of October.  
*Micha³:*  
What a bunch of f**kers, .  
*Micha³:*  
I’m dropping a deuce and then heading out.  
*Micha³:*  
So, I’ll be there around 5:55 PM.  
*Micha³:*  
Mhmmm, I thought it wasn’t our building anymore.
